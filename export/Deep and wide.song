[G]Deep and wide,
[C]Deep and wide,
[G]There’s a fountain flowing deep and wide,[D]
[G]Deep and wide,
[C]Deep and wide,
There’s a f[G]ountain f[D]lowing deep and wid[G]e,

[G]Wide, wide as the ocean,
High as the heavens above[C],
[D]Deep, deep as the de[G]epest sea,
Is [A7]my Savior’s [D7]love.
[G]I though so unworthy,
Still I’m a child of H[C]is care,
For His word teaches me,
[G]That His love reaches me,
[D7]Every[G]where.
