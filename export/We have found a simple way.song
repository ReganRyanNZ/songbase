We have [G]found a simple way
For us to really touch the [G7]Lord;
All we d[C]o is pray four words,
And, oh, what gra[G]ce He does af[D]ford!
From our [G]spirit now we say them,
And we spr[B7]ead the news ab[Em]road:
It’s [Am]easy to [D]touch the [G]Lord!

{start_of_chorus}
[G]O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah[G7]!
[C]O Lord, Amen, Halle[G]luj[D]ah!
[G]O Lord, Amen, Hallel[B7]uja[Em]h!
It’s [Am]easy to [D]touch the [G]Lord![C] [G]
