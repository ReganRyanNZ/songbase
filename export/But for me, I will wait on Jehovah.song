But for [C]me, I will [F]wait on [C]Jehovah;
I will [C]look for the [F]God of my [G]strength;
In the [C]darkness Je[F]hovah will [C]shine like a [F]light;
Let my [C]enemies [G]no more re[C]joice[C7].
For I [F]fall, but then I will rise [C]up;
Praise the [F]Lord, Who’s the strength of my [G]heart;
So for [C]me, I will [F]wait on the [C]Lord Jesus [F]Christ;
And in [C]Christ I will [G]rise up a[C]gain.
