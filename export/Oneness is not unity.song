[A][D]Oneness is not unity[A],
Outward agreement
[Bm]But a [D]life within—
God’s [A]very life!
The Triune [E]God[D] included [A]us[E]
In His div[F#m]i[D]ne

T[Bm]hat they al[D]l may be on[A]e;
Even as You [Bm]Fath[D]er, are in [A]Me
And I in Y[E]ou—
[D]That they may [A]be—[E]
May be in Us.[F#m]  [D]
