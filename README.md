# songbase
Song sheet database for psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs

## Getting Started

You might need to install postgres, the easiest way is to download and run postgres.app. Follow the app's setup tutorial to install CLI tools as well.

- `bundle install`
- `rails db:create`
- `rails db:migrate`
- `heroku pg:backups:download` to get 'latest.dump' (you'll need heroku access)
- `pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -d songbase_development latest.dump` to load 'latest.dump' into dev db

If you don't have heroku access, send an email to songbase.brothers@gmail.com to request a DB dump (I think the app won't run without data in the db).

## Backstory
If you want a bit of a backstory on songbase: I was in a high school church meeting one time, seeing some new ones from a very poor background. Someone was showing them isilo and trying to convince them to pay something like $20 for an app decades behind the times, just so they can get the song lyrics on their phone. It made me angry that there was such a high barrier. I also noticed that we produce new songbooks for the young people all the time—and within a year there are new songs they want to sing that aren't in those books. So we try adding to the back of them, or printing new books. Eventually with some help I created songbase with the following goals:

- Continually (and crowd-sourced) updated songs—even within a meeting I can fix a typo or add a new song.
- Fast. This should feel instant, not like scrolling a website.
- Completely distraction free. I love hymnal.net and the excerpts and comments and sound files and social media links, it's a great resource for studying the songs. But in meetings we found it a bit distracting for the saints, to finish a song but then start scrolling through the comments.

​There are a lot of other features, but these are the ones that I love.

## Using the API
A few people have reached out about making a similar project, but using the data from songbase. This is great! May we all find ways to help one another serve our God and His people. My best recommendation here is to use songbase's api, either directly from the client or at least regularly syncing to your db. Here are the endpoints:

- `https://songbase.life/api/v1/app_data` grabs all the data for songs and songbooks, this might be good for a giant refresh.
​- `https://songbase.life/api/v1/languages` gets a list of all the languages in the db.
- `https://songbase.life/api/v1/app_data?language=english` grabs all the data only for english songs (and so on for each language)​. If you get the languages first, and then fetch each language at the same time, you can download everything much faster, and have some songs loading before everything has finished.
- ​`https://songbase.life/api/v1/app_data?updated_at=1655130159689` gets a list of data--but only what has changed after the `updated_at` timestamp. Songbase sends this with `updated_at` being the result of `new Date().getTime()` (in JS) to only get new data, instead of redownloading the entire db every time you load the site. This is pretty important if the client is fetching the API, since the full download will be several mb in size.

If you are interested in the api for creating your own software, I would recommend checking out `app/assets/javascripts/components/SongDisplay.jsx` to see how the raw song data is converted to html (and transposing is also there).

## react-rails

This was first a Rails app, now it uses React to allow state management and offline navigation. Instead of maintaining two separate apps, the frontend and backend are (somewhat mashed) together in this project. The main difference is that React is served through a Rails gem, and importing/exporting JS components doesn't work like a regular React project.

## Features
- Users can view lyrics and chords to songs
- Languages can be toggled
- Any song/book navigation is offline (after first visiting the site)
- Site navigation and search is instant
- Songs can be filtered by search or by book
- Within a book, index can be sorted by title or by index number
- Search lyrics as well as first line
- Backend users can log in via google
- Backend users can enter new songs and edit songs
- Infinite scrolling to speed up search loading.
- References at the end of a song bring the user to the index of that book
- Fully offline! After initial load, clients should be able to later load songbase even without internet connection (it's patchy, confirmed working on chrome for android)


# TODO

### search

- app search (and admin I suppose) should ignore any non letters. e.g. 'glory-crowned' and 'glory crowned' should be the same

### Cheaper fetching

- compress api data for smaller downloads, would need to uncompress on client end

### CRUD books

- Add a local book by default called "My Favorites"
- At the bottom of songs, where the book refs are, add a "+ [book name]" for every local-owned book
- At the bottom of the books page, add a "+" that shows an input and submit to make a local book (maybe an HR can separate this from the list of references, and another to separate the song).
- Local books need a delete btn on the index page, and an "export" button that gives a url for others to import. Delete and export could be under a burger menu.
- Local books are not globally synced.
- Local books should be uniquely named, and importing a dup name should ask if you want to delete the previous (i..e a kind of simple override to simulate updating)

### Book printing

- [done] First stage is to get a single song with chords in a copy-paste format.
- Second stage is to get the whole book as back-to-back copy-paste songs. This is probably the best state because people still want to edit and move things around.
